    <h2>Artistic Vision</h2>
    <p>
        Semeion is something between mechanic and organic. Semeion is an Intranet of Beings. Semeion is an evolving species.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Each semeion being communicates with human beings through touch and proximity, and expresses itself through light and sound. Since semeia are social creatures, as they engage in communication with humans, they simultaneously communicate with their fellows. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Semeia also evolve over time. If they have experienced aggression in their lives, they may become accustomed to it, and hardly able to react to anything else. Perhaps a single being has experienced much kindness, but its fellows are only used to a different behavior. The kind being may have to adapt to its surroundings, and follow its fellows' signals. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Semeion is a complex ecosystem of mechanical beings that express themselves as organic light creatures. Through our human bodies we can choose how to engage with them as they choose how to engage with us. Semeion is our way of exploring how the relation between humans and technology can be more humane, embodied and dynamic than what we are accustomed to.

    <h2>In detail</h2>
    <h3>The physical</h3>
    <p>
        Each semeion presents itself as a glowing crystalline structure. Semeia exist in varying sizes, some reaching almost the height of an average human being. The light of a semeion glows in a limited spectrum of colors. Light and sound are a semeion's modes of communication with human beings.  As such a semeion's light intensity, its color and its audio expression may change over time in an attempt to convey its feelings in relation to human interaction.
    </p>
    <h3>The interactive</h3>
    <p>
        A semeion is able to detect human proximity as well as human touch. Through these modes, a human can convey sentiment towards the semeion, be it fear, respect, curiosity or something else. Depending on its earlier experiences, a semeion may light up in anticipation of contact from an approaching human, or it may flash brightly as a warning sign due to previous poor experiences with humans. Once close, humans can also express themselves through touch. The semeia could be treated as pets in need of attention and as such receive a prolonged caress. Or the being may be seen by the human as a machine whose inner action-reaction flow must be explored and deduced. No matter what, the semeion will remember the interaction and evolve.
    </p>
    <h3>The temporal</h3>
    <p>
        As time passes and the semeia accrue a bank of experiences, they will adapt. Perhaps they find that showing human beings a soft turquoise light followed by a clicking sound encourages caresses, and as such this could be their preferred state. Maybe they find that human beings can be rough when engaging with machines, and therefore they want to coax us into being softer, and they may find that the best way to do this is to emit low frequency sounds accompanied by a bright blue flashing.
